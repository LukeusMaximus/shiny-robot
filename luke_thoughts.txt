1 AA vs 1 SHVR:
    No trades occur.
    Both try slowly to adjust their bids towards the equilibrium price. Shaver will start bidding at the worst bid / ask price until a trade occurs (which will be produced through the interactions of the other bots). It will slowly move towards the equilibrium price, however, Shaver is constrained to doing this 1 unit at a time through out-bidding / out-asking the other bots; since the only other bot is AA (which doesn't bid / ask very often) it will usually be out-bidding / out-asking itself. This causes Shaver to move linearly towards the equilibrium.
